Domain: [What to Wear](https://wtwr-jjsprint15.chickenkiller.com/)

# What to wear: FrontEnd

Its simple. What to wear is a project that takes a users loaction and the weather in the specified location and then suggests clothes for the user to wear. The user can add and delete clothes in their closet. The project was made using React.js and CSS. I created and programmed an entire back-end and server using node.js, express.js and mongoDB to seamlessly take care of the users requests here on the front-end.

# Sprint 14
Back-End Authentication and Authorization
## Project 14
### WTWR - full stack
se_project_react

se_project_express

### Overview:
- Intro to Front-End Authentication with React
- Intro to Web Application Security
- Links

### Intro:
This project represents an important first in your software engineer journey: you’ll connect your frontend and backend and create a full-stack application. In this project, you'll:

Implement the logic for signing up, signing in, and signing out
Add new context to store data about the current user
Implement the logic for editing a profile
Implement the ability for users to add likes to clothing items
In the process, you'll also utilize the API you created in projects 12 and 13 to send fetch requests.

This implementation ensures secure user management while maintaining the RESTful architecture established in the previous sprint.

This project can be run with these prompts:

- `npm run start` — to launch the server
- cd server_se_project_express
- cd web_se_project_react
- `npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
- this launches the server as a local host
- next sprint will deploy this website to the web
  
### Features:
- Front End Authentication and Authorization 
- Web Security
- JS Web token on the frontend
